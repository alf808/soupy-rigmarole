all subnets in same NACL

have a public sg for the bastion


create a private sg for the private instance

add an inbound SSH with source of public sg
description: ssh only on internal network

after getting into private SSH, turn off public SSH

to get the private out to the internet we need to add
the nat gateway in private route table
note: make sure nat gateway is in public subnet

edit private rtb to delete reference

when private instance is patched turn off delete nat gateway
release EIP
